# Logitech G700

I've used a [Logitech G700](https://amzn.to/2Q58nJV) as my mouse since 2011. I
love it so much that I bought another one as a backup.

## Features

* Wireless
    * The wireless dongle can be stored in the mouse itself
    * Easily replaceable AA battery
    * Comes with an [Eneloop battery](https://amzn.to/2Q5HPbg) that I am still using over seven years later
* Wired mode
    * For both charging and data
* Scroll wheel
    * Can tilt to the left and right
    * Can be toggled between a free spinning mode and a ratcheted mode
* Profiles
    * On board memory for storing profiles
    * Don't need to install software on every computer (useful for corporate PCs)
    * Profiles can be imported/exported (so they are versioned in this repo)
* Buttons
    * Three buttons next to the left click
    * Four buttons on the left side

## Alternatives

* [Logitech G700S](https://amzn.to/2LY7lvY)
    * Newer than the G700, but it's ugly as sin
    * Doesn't seem to offer anything new
* [Razer Naga Epic Chroma](https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-naga-epic-chroma)
    * More buttons
    * RGB lighting
    * But the wireless receiver is built into the charging dock

## Button mappings

* Four buttons on the left side
    * Back
    * Forward
    * Copy
    * Paste
* Three buttons next to the left click
    * Show all open windows
    * New tab
    * Close tab/window
* Scroll wheel
    * Left tilt to go to the previous tab
    * Right tilt to go to the next tab
