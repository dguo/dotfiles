# Logitech G600

This is my configuration for my [Logitech
G600](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse.910-002864.html)
mouse. It's cheap, has a ton of buttons (because it's intended for
[MMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game)s), and it
has an extra button for the ring finger that enables G-Shift mode, which lets
you configure secondary functionality for every button.

Use [Logitech Gaming
Software](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-nz/articles/360025298053-Logitech-Gaming-Software)
to configure the mouse. Don't use [G
HUB](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/innovation/g-hub.html). It forces you to
use macros even for simple key combinations, you can't save those macros to the
onboard memory, and even the macros that I tried didn't work well (I got weird
phantom key presses). LGS is ancient and doesn't support Apple Silicon (even
with Rosetta), but it does the job on Windows. Just use the Windows key as a
replacement for Apple's command key when setting up key bindings.

## Configuration

Change the number of DPI levels to 1 and set the DPI to 1750.

Turn on the lighting effect, set it to cycle lighting, and the speed to the
middle.

These are the key bindings for normal mode.
