    * The wireless dongle can be stored in the mouse itself
    * Easy replaceable AA battery
    * Comes with an [Eneloop battery](https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-K-KJ17MCA4BA-Individual-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B00JHKSMJU) that I am still using over five years later
* Wired mode
    * For both charging and data
* Sroll wheel
    * Can tilt to the left and right
    * Can be toggled between a free spinning mode and a ratcheted mode
* Profiles
    * On board memory for storing profiles
    * Don't need to install software on every computer (useful for corporate PCs)
    * Profiles can be imported/exported (so they are versioned in this repo)

    * Three buttons next to the left click
    * Four buttons on the left side

## Alternatives
* [Logitech G700S](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G700s-910-003584-Rechargeable-Gaming/dp/B00BFOEY3Y)
    * Newer than the G700, but it's ugly as sin
    * Doesn't seem to offer anything new
* [Razer Naga Epic Chroma](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Multi-Color-Wireless-Buttons-RZ01-01230100-R3U1/dp/B00NW6T6CC)
    * More buttons, which is a huge plus
    * Lights are nice
    * But the wireless receiver is built into the charging dock
